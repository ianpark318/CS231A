# CS231A  
![img](/img/cs231a.png)
This repo contains some codes of Stanford Univ. lecture [CS231A: Computer Vision, From 3D Reconstruction to Recognition](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/index.html)' Problem Set.  
  
I'm not Stanford student but studied this lecture by myself.  
and I thought it would be great if there is summary written in Korean.  
That's why I made this repository and summary notes.  
So you guys are allowed to use my code and check for summary below.
